FRONTEND - MIDDLEEND - BACKEND

- We need intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends reques, we will be able to make decision that the microservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as the middle end
